# Autonomous-Car-Driving 

In this the YOLO model is fitted in car and it will detect whether the pedestrian, car, motorcycle are there in front, side of car or not if it is there the car wil detect it.

With the IOU that is Intersection Oevr Union means it is a calculation part for bounding boxes in which if theree are 2 predicting bounding box with the object is there or not probability written. It is the part of the   NON-MAX SUPPRESSION it is used when there is an obverlappin of the bounding boxes.

The IOU and NON-MAX SUPPRSSION  is used to made the perfect bounding box over the image.

So, this model is used to detect is there is any object or classs over to the car as it is self autonomous and so it can deteect it with this and found any it stop the car or lower it speed.

The probability of bounding box means that if it found any object then it will create bounding box and the probability is calculated on 2 bases fiest it will identify the class and by vector sum and the probability will be the answer of that vector sum, second oone is the distance between the object from the car.

So this is the description of the SELF-DRIVING-CAR for detecting the object.
